# Sphero Swarm

## Description
The "Sphero Swarm" project is an innovative endeavor undertaken by the Autonomous Robotics Club at Purdue University in collaboration with Imagination Labs. This project aims to utilize Sphero robot balls to create a captivating exhibit that showcases molecular structures in an interactive and visually compelling manner. By orchestrating the movement of these Sphero robots, the project seeks to provide an engaging educational experience for audiences of all ages, promoting a deeper understanding of chemistry and inspiring scientific curiosity.

## Features
- **Educational Engagement:** The project focuses on enhancing comprehension of molecular structures through interactive exhibits.
- **Sphero Control and Coordination:** Advanced algorithms and control systems are developed to synchronize the movements of multiple Sphero balls, mimicking the spatial arrangements of atoms within various molecules.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Visitors can actively participate in the exhibit by influencing the behavior of the Sphero robots and forming molecular structures.
- **Scalability:** The project offers a flexible framework capable of depicting a wide range of molecules, ensuring versatility and adaptability.

## Components and Technologies
- **Sphero Robot Balls:** These versatile and precise spherical robots serve as the foundation of the exhibit.
- **Custom Software:** Specialized software is developed to control and coordinate the movement of the Sphero robots, translating molecular structures into captivating choreographies.
- **Visualization and Projection:** Visual aids and detailed molecular models are projected alongside the Sphero formations, providing additional context and insight.

## Subteams
The project is divided into five subteams, each focusing on specific aspects:
1. **Controls:** Controls the balls directly using Bluetooth signals.
2. **Algorithms:** Creates the algorithms which the balls utilize to move.
3. **Perception:** Uses OpenCV and a camera to check for errors and correct them.
4. **Hardware:** Creates, manufactures, and designs the physical matrix field which the Sphero balls move on.
5. **Interface:** Creates the app which the users will use to interact with the exhibit.
